# Scrapwebbing

Scrapwebbing is a tool for creating photo albums, which can be shared between different users. We wanted to share some photos with our parents back in Korea, but did not want to use facebook, which automatically shares photos with all of our friends. Also, we intended to create a family photo album on a webpage in order to overcome the problem of living far away from each other.


## Features

- Secure albums via unique user names and passwords
- User can upload as many as albums and photos in each album
- User can easily upload album picture and photos by copying the image location
- User can change the background of each album
- Users can share individual album with other users
- Used Bootstrap

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies with `bundle install`
3. Create the database with `rake db:create db:migrate` (you will need to have postgres installed)
4. Run this app with `rackup` or `shotgun`
